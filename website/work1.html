        <p class="paddingBot">Svalegaarden Mest's current website didn't reflect restaurant's personality and
            high-quality services they provide. Our task was to redesign and improve the current website through design,
            code and IA. My role in this project was coding, I had to face several challenges, as I was merging and
            editing code from two other coders.</p>

        <p class="">My coding proces starts by obtaining high-fidelity mockups and content, from the desing
            part of our team. I create structure in HTML and fill it with given content then add CSS and
            JavaScript. The biggest challenge was that many of classes had similar names across the group members.
            There was a problem with merging code ftom my teammates. I had to merge and edit two different
            parts of code.

        <p class=" item3">The problem was that many of classes had similar names across the group members.
            This caused that parts of the code were repeated. I solved this problem by comering the code and I reduced
            redundant code as much as possible. This also caused that lot of parts of the code were repeated. I solved
            this problem by renaming the classes and I tried to reduce redundant code as much as possible.

            <p class="solutionP">This project has taught me how to work with naming conventions and Git Hub that really
                excelerates development and prevents loss or disfunction of code. I learned how to communicate better among
                group members and solve problems together. Despite all the obstacles that accompanied us through the process
                we delivered our finished product on time.
